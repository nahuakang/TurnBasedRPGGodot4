# Turn-Based RPG in Godot 4

This repository contains a turn-based RPG game created by following HeartBeast's
Godot LTS course [Make a Stunning Turn-based RPG](https://courses.heartgamedev.com/p/turn-based-course).

The original code base can be found on [HeartBeast's Github](https://github.com/uheartbeast/Turn-based-Course).
Since Godot 4's release, I have decided to implement the game using the updated version of
the Godot engine with the newer GDScript 2 that offers better syntax and an improved type system.
